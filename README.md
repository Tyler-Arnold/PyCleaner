# PyCleaner
A solution for those of you who keep downloading rubbish to your desktop.

This horrible abomination was an experiment in using Tkinter to make a GUI.

I also happened to need a good way to clean up my documents folder as I'd been using it as a downloads folder.
So, in an attempt to sweep the mess under the bed, I wrote a quick program that moves files with a certain file extension to a certain place.

Built in Python 3
